# HighSchool-Projects
These are my projects I have made over the course of time


# PyCharm Evolving Car notes (pyg.py)

- pressing 'd' or changing the brain size will reset the entire simulation to default settings.

- if cars seem to 'dissapear', I believe they are merely on top of each other reset simulation to get a new start if this bothers you

- 'weightInitRange' takes the -n to n and randomly innitializes new cars with it.

- Experiment with the sliders to get a car to eventually evolve

- I have gotten the cars all the way around by the 250th generation

# Python Genetic Algorithm Example Using Strings (geneticalgo.py)
- String evolves towards target word over time
- can use capital letters and numbers

# Proccessing Genetic Algorithm Example Using Strings (...)
- String evolves towards target word over time

# Racket Pool
- fully functional game of 2d pool
- currently not multiplayer
- some minor changes, to be published soon

# Racket Checkers
- Fully functional game of checkers
- Bug where you can jump back to same spot indefinitely (Ill fix it eventually)
- Main.rkt is where checkers is located
- run checker server to play against a second player.
- 'launch-many-worlds' creates 2 games, comment this out if you want to play by yourself

# Garden Automation
- Using ESP8266 outlet to do this. Drop a reccomendation for easily flashible outlets
- Using itead outlet, pictures soon


# 3D self evolving cars
- this is made in proccessing 3d
- physics is a little odd but it works
