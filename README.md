# HighSchool-Projects
These are my projects I have made over the course of time


# PyCharm Evolving Car notes (pyg.py)

- pressing 'd' will reset the entire simulation to default settings.

- if cars seem to 'dissapear', I believe they are merely on top of each other reset simulation to get a new start

- 'weightInitRange' takes the -n to n and randomly innitializes new cars with it.

- Experiment with the sliders to get a car the eventually evolves

# PyCharm Genetic Algorithm Example Using Strings (geneticalgo.py)
- String evolves towards target word over time

# Proccessing Genetic Algorithm Example Using Strings (...)
- String evolves towards target word over time
